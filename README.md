# 🛠️ MaxHeap Implementation in C#

This C# console application implements a **Max Heap** data structure from scratch, providing functionality for inserting elements, verifying the heap property, deleting elements, merging heaps, sorting, and finding the k-th largest element. It's designed as a hands-on educational tool for practicing data structures and algorithmic thinking.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔢 Insert elements into a heap
- ✅ Check if the current structure is a valid max-heap
- ❌ Delete a value from the heap
- 🧮 Print the heap in sorted order (Heap Sort)
- 🔗 Merge two heaps
- 🔍 Find the k-th largest element
- 📃 Print the current heap
- 🖥️ Console-based interactive UI
